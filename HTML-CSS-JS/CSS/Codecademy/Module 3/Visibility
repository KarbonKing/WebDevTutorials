Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property.

The visibility property can be set to one of the following values:

hidden — hides an element.
visible — displays an element.
collapse — collapses an element.


.future {
  visibility: hidden;
}


It will still leave an empty space where the element is intended to display.





Note: What’s the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden? 

An element with display: none will be completely removed from the web page. 
An element with visibility: hidden, however, will not be visible on the web 
page, but the space reserved for it will.
