DOCTYPE Declaration


HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. 
We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with:


<!DOCTYPE html>



-  It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version 
of HTML is being used in the document.

- To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include <!DOCTYPE html> at 
the very beginning of your HTML documents.
