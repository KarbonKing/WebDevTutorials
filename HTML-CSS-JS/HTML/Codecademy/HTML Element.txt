<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body></body>
</html>

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags after 
declaring <!DOCTYPE html>

Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. 
Without these tags, itâ€™s possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.
