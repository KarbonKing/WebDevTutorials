The font-weight property controls how bold or thin text appears. 
It can be specified with keywords or numerical values.

The font-weight property can take any one of these values:

bold: Bold font weight.
normal: Normal font weight. This is the default value.
lighter: One font weight lighter than the element’s parent value.
bolder: One font weight bolder than the element’s parent value

Numerical values can range from 1 (lightest) to 1000 (boldest), 
but it is common practice to use increments of 100. A font weight 
of 400 is equal to the keyword value normal, and a font weight of 
700 is equal to bold.

**It’s important to note that not all fonts can be assigned a 
numeric font weight, and not all numeric font weights are available 
to all fonts. It’s a good practice to look up the font you are using 
to see which font-weight values are available.**
