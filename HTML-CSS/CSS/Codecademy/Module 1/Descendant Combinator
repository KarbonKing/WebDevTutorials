CSS also supports selecting elements that are nested 
within other HTML elements, also known as descendants.
These descendants can be called in CSS by specifying the
parent and descendant selectors as shown.


HTML
<ul class='main-list'>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul>


CSS
.main-list li {
 color: grey;
}

ul li{
    font: futura;
}

The descendant selectors are separatated by spaces.
