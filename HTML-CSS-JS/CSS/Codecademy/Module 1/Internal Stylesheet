HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated 
section with a <style> element nested inside of the 
<head> element. The CSS code inside the <style> element 
is often referred to as an internal stylesheet.


** The <style> element must be placed inside of the 
<head> element.

<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: red;
      font-size: 20px;
    }

    nav {
      background-color: black;
      font-size: 45px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
