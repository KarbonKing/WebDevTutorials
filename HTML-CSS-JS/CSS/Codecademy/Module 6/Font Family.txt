The font of an element can be changed using the font-family property.

h1 {
  font-family: Arial;
}



When specifying a typeface with multiple words, like Times New Roman, 
it is recommended to use quotation marks (' ') to group the words together.

h1 {
  font-family: 'Times New Roman';
}



***There is a selection of fonts that will appear the same across all browsers 
and operating systems. These fonts are referred to as web safe fonts. Web safe 
fonts are good fallback fonts that can be used if your preferred font is not 
available.***

h1 {
  font-family: Caslon, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;
}

In the example above, Georgia and Times New Roman are fallback fonts to Caslon. 
When you specify a group of fonts, you have what is known as a font stack. A 
font stack usually contains a list of similar-looking fonts. Serif and sans-serif 
are also keyword values that can be added as a final fallback font if nothing 
else in the font stack is available.
