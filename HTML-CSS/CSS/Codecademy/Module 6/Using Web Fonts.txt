Free font services, like Google Fonts and Adobe Fonts, host fonts 
that you can link to from your HTML document with a provided 
<link> element.

You can also use fonts from paid font distributors like fonts.com 
by downloading and hosting them with the rest of your site’s files. 
You can create a @font-face ruleset in your CSS stylesheet to link 
to the relative path of the font file.

Web Font Linking

When you select a font in Google Fonts, you’ll be shown all of the 
different styles available for that particular font. You can then 
select the styles you want to use on your site. When you’re done 
selecting a font and its styles, you can review your selected font 
family, and a <link> element will be automatically generated for 
you to use on your site!

The generated <link> element needs to be added to the <head> element 
in your HTML document for it to be ready to be used in your CSS. 
You can then create font-family declarations in your CSS using the 
font.

HTML
<head>
  <!-- Add the link element for Google Fonts along with other metadata -->
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@100&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

CSS
p {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}




Font File Linking

Fonts can also be added using a @font-face ruleset in your CSS 
stylesheet instead of using a <link> element in your HTML document. 
As mentioned earlier, fonts can be downloaded just like any other 
file on the web. They come in a few different file formats, such as:

OTF (OpenType Font)
TTF (TrueType Font)
WOFF (Web Open Font Format)
WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2)

With WOFF2 being the most progressive. It’s a good idea to include 
TTF, WOFF, and WOFF2 formats with your @font-face rule to ensure 
compatibility on all browsers. 
Within the “Selected Families” section of Google Fonts, you can use 
the “Download” button to download the font files to your computer. 
The files will be downloaded as a single format, in this case, TTF. 
You can use a tool such as Google Web Fonts Helper to generate 
additional file types for WOFF and WOFF2. When you have the files 
you need, move them to a folder inside your website’s working 
directory, and you’re ready to use them in a @font-face ruleset!

CSS
@font-face {
  font-family: 'ExampleFontName';
  src: url('fonts/Roboto.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('fonts/Roboto.woff') format('woff'),
       url('fonts/Roboto.ttf') format('truetype');
}

 - The @font-face at-rule is used as the selector. It’s recommended 
   to define the @font-face ruleset at the top of your CSS stylesheet.
 - The font-family property is used to set a custom name for the 
   downloaded font. It must be surrounded by quotation marks.
 - The src property contains three values, each specifying the relative 
   path to the font file and its format.

Once the @font-face at-rule is defined, you can use the font in 
your stylesheet! INCLUDE QUOTATION MARKS
