The attribute selector can be used to target HTML elements 
that already contain attributes.This alleviates the need to 
add new code, like the class or id attributes. get more 
granular from there by adding type and/or attribute values. 
One way is by using type[attribute*=value].


<img src='/images/seasons/cold/winter.jpg'>
<img src='/images/seasons/warm/summer.jpg'>


img[src*='winter'] {
  height: 50px;
}
 
img[src*='summer'] {
  height: 100px;
}

These ruleset looks for an img element with an attribute 
of src that contains the value specified. The example above
shows that we can even specify keywords within the attribute's value
