Audio Element

The <audio> element is used to embed audio content into 
a document. Like <video>, <audio> uses src to link the 
audio source. We create a <source> element to encapsulate 
our audio link. We specify the kind of audio file being
linked with the type attribute.



<audio>
  <source src="iAmAnAudioFile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>



There are many attributes for <audio> but two common 
attributes are controls and src.

controls: automatically displays the audio controls into 
the browser such as play and mute.

src: specifies the URL of the audio file.
