Images


The <img> tag allows you to add an image to a web page.
    - self-closing tag
    - Note that the end of the <img> tag has a forward slash /. 
      Self-closing tags may include or omit the final slash — both will render properly.
    -The src attribute must be set to the image’s source, or the location of the image.


<img src="image-location.jpg" />


- src is a required attribute

<img src="LINK/URL" alt="A field of yellow sunflowers" />



The alt attribute, which means alternative text, brings meaning to the images
  - The value of alt should be a description of the image.




The alt attribute also plays a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), because search engines cannot 
“see” the images on websites as they crawl the internet. Having descriptive alt attributes 
can improve the ranking of your site.
