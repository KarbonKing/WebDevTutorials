The <label> element has an opening and closing tag and displays text 
that is written between the opening and closing tags. To associate 
a <label> and an <input>, the <input> needs an id attribute. We then 
assign the for attribute of the <label> element with the value of the 
id attribute of <input>

<label for="meal">What do you want to eat?</label>
<br>
<input type="text" name="food" id="meal">

The for attribute in <label> ties it to the id attribute in <input>
