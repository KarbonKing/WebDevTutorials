Video Element

The <video> element makes it clear that a developer is 
attempting to display a video to the user. Some attributes 
that can alter a video playback include:

controls: When added in, a play/pause button will be 
added onto the video along with volume control and a 
fullscreen option.

autoplay: The attribute which results in a video 
automatically playing as soon as the page is loaded.

loop: This attribute results in the video continuously 
playing on repeat.
