pseudo-class selectors

When you click on an <input> element, and a blue border
 is added showing that it is in focus.

When you click on a blue <a> link to visit to another page, 
but when you return the link’s text is purple.

When you’re filling out a form and the submit button is 
grayed out and disabled. But when all of the fields have 
been filled out, the button has color showing that it’s active.

Psuedo Selectors: :focus, :visited, :disabled, :active



p:hover {
  background-color: lime;
}

This will make the paragraph element turn lime when the cursor
hovers over it.
