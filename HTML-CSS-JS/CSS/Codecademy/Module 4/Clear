The clear property specifies how elements should behave when 
they bump into each other on the page. 
It can take on one of the following values:

left—the left side of the element will not touch any other 
element within the same containing element.

right—the right side of the element will not touch any other 
element within the same containing element.

both—neither side of the element will touch any other element 
within the same containing element.

none—the element can touch either side.
