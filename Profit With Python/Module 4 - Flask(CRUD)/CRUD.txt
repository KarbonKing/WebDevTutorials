Create - Posting new data to websites
Read - reading data from web pages

Many sites work in a fashion where the frontend of the sites
calls back to a spreadsheet like database that takes data into
specific data fields set prior.

 likes, dislikes, views, comments, shares, date posted, etc.


Youtube - Python
Instagram - Python, Django
