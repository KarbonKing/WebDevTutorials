Type Selector: matches the type of the element in the 
HTML document.

The element type is p, which comes from the HTML <p> tag.

Some important notes on the type selector:

The type selector does not include the angle brackets.
Since element types are often referred to by their 
opening tag name, the type selector is sometimes 
referred to as the tag name or element selector.

p {
  color: green;
}


** p is the type selector **
