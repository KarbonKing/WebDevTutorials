Personalizing Your Portfolio with HTML (Front End)


Navigate to Heroku account

Select App

Navigate to Deploy > Deployment Method > GitHub

Enter repo that needs to be connected

Select "Enable Automatic Deploys"

Code that is edited within GitHub will now be pushed to Heroku for deployment once it's been committed to the Main Branch of the repo.

HTML Front End can be adjusted and once committed the app should be updated with a refresh.

Now when pushing GitHub updates from your local system the Heroku app will automatically
deploy the changes!


Local System > GitHub > Heroku > Product
