An elementâ€™s content has two dimensions: a height and a width.
The CSS height and width properties can be used to modify these 
default dimensions.

p {
  height: 80px;
  width: 240px;
}

The px in the code above stands for pixels.
When the width and height of an element are set in pixels, 
it will be the same size on all devices.
