Backend Personalization - Python

Like the Frontend example, python code can be edited and pushed to the repo
for Automatic Deployment to Heroku.

Python solely provides the backend support using the flask framework in this
case so we'll be editing the .py file

If the code is not viable then the Heroku build check will render a build error.


Ex.

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def home_page():
	return render_template('index.html')

The following block of code renders index.html as the home page(/)


ie.
https://URL/   - Home Page
https://URL/about - About Page
