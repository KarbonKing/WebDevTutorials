Opacity can be specified using the Alpha property declarations.
Alpha can only be used with HSL, RGB, and hex colors; we cannot 
add the alpha value to name colors like green. The name of the 
property is Alpha. Alpha is set on a scale from 0(Transparent) 
to 1(Opaque). There is, however, a named color keyword for zero 
opacity, transparent.
