These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, 
but their width property can also be set. Unless otherwise 
specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their 
content. Elements that are block-level by default include all 
levels of heading elements (<h1> through <h6>), <p>, <div> and 
<footer>.
