Personalizing Your Portfolio with HTML (Front End)

Enable Automatic Deployments - Heroku

1. Navigate to Heroku account
2. Select App
3. Navigate to Deploy > Deployment Method > GitHub
4. Enter repo that needs to be connected
5. Select "Enable Automatic Deploys"


Code that is edited within GitHub will now be pushed to Heroku for deployment
once it's been committed to the Main Branch of the repo.

HTML Front End can be adjusted and once committed the app should be updated with a refresh.
Now when pushing GitHub updates from your local system the Heroku app will automatically
deploy the changes!

Local System > GitHub > Heroku > Product
