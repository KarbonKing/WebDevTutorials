Letter Spacing - used to set the horizontal spacing between the individual 
characters in an element. It can sometimes help the readability of certain 
fonts or styles. The letter-spacing property takes length values in units, 
such as 2px or 0.5em.

p {
  letter-spacing: 2px;
}



Word Spacing - used to set the space between words in an element. 
This property takes length values in units, such as 3px or 0.2em. Using em 
values are recommended because the spacing can be set based on the size of 
the font.

h1 {
  word-spacing: 0.3em;
}



Line Height - set how tall we want each line containing our text to be. 
Line height values can be a unitless number, such as 1.2, or a length value, 
such as 12px, 5% or 2em. The unitless value is preferred since it is 
responsive based on the current font size.

p {
  line-height: 1.4;
}



Text Alignment - aligns text to its parent element.
text-align: left|right|center|justify|initial|inherit;

h1 {
  text-align: right;
}
