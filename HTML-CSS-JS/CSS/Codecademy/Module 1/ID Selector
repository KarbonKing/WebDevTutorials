If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely, we can give 
it an ID using the id attribute. An elementâ€™s id can only have 
a single value, and only be used once per page.

The id name is large-title, therefore the CSS selector for it is 
#large-title.



<h1 id='large-title'> ... </h1>

#large-title {
 color: red;
}
