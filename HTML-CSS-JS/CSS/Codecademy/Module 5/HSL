Hue, Saturation, Lightness

The first number represents the degree of the hue, and 
can be between 0 and 360. The second and third numbers 
are percentages representing saturation and lightness 
respectively. 

Hue is the first number. It refers to an angle on a 
color wheel. Red is 0 degrees, Green is 120 degrees, 
Blue is 240 degrees, and then back to Red at 360.

Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the 
color. The saturation increases towards 100% as the 
color becomes richer. The saturation decreases towards 
0% as the color becomes grayer.

Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. 
Halfway, or 50%, is normal lightness. Sliding the dimmer 
up towards 100% makes the color lighter, closer to white.

HSL is also useful for making a set of colors that work 
well together by selecting various colors that have the 
same lightness and saturation but different hues.
