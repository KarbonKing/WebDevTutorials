The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding.
In CSS, you can modify this space with the padding property.


p.content-header {
  border: 3px solid coral;
  padding: 10px;
}

The code in this example puts 10 pixels of space between the 
content of the paragraph (the text) and the borders, on all 
four sides.


padding: 25px 50px 75px 100px;
top padding is 25px
right padding is 50px
bottom padding is 75px
left padding is 100px


padding: 25px 50px 75px;
top padding is 25px
right and left paddings are 50px
bottom padding is 75px


padding: 25px 50px;
top and bottom paddings are 25px
right and left paddings are 50px
