div.headline {
  width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

In the example above, margin: 0 auto; will center the divs 
in their containing elements. The 0 sets the top and bottom 
margins to 0 pixels. The auto value instructs the browser to 
adjust the left and right margins until the element is 
centered within its containing element.

In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element. 
Otherwise, the width of the div will be automatically set to the 
full width of its containing element, like the <body>, for example. 
Itâ€™s not possible to center an element that takes up the full width 
of the page, since the width of the page can change due to display 
and/or browser window size.
