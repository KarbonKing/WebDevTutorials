Linking your external CSS File


You can use the <link> element to link HTML and CSS 
files together. The <link> element must be placed within 
the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and 
requires the following attributes:


href — like the anchor element, the value of this 
attribute must be the URL, or path, to the CSS file.

rel — this attribute describes the relationship between 
the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking 
to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.



<link href='https://www.URL.com/style.css' rel='stylesheet'>

                    or


<link href='C:/temp/example.css' rel='stylesheet'>
