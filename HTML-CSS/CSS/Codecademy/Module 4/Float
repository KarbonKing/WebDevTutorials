Capable of moving an element as far left or as far right 
as possible in the container. This works for static and 
relative positioned elements.


The float property is often set using one of the values below:

left - moves, or floats, elements as far left as possible.
right - moves elements as far right as possible.


.orange-section {
  background-color: orange;
  width: 50%;
  float: right;
}

**Floated elements must have a width specified**
