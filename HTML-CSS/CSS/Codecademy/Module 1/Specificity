Specificity is the order by which the browser decides 
which CSS styles will be displayed. A best practice in 
CSS is to style elements while using the lowest degree 
of specificity so that if an element needs a new style, 
it is easy to override. To make styles easy to edit, 
itâ€™s best to style with a type selector, if possible. 
If not, add a class selector. If that is not specific 
enough, then consider using an ID selector.

If an element is selected by through different rulesets 
with a type, class and id selector then the element
will prioritize the id selector ruleset.
