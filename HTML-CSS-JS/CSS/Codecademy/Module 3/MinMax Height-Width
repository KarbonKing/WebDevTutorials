Because a web page can be viewed through displays of 
differing screen size, we can use the following properties 
to set minimum and maximum height and width.

min-width
max-width
min-height
max-height


p {
  min-width: 300px;
  max-width: 600px;
  min-height: 150px;
  max-height: 300px;
}


What will happen to the contents of an element’s box if the 
max-height property is set too low? It’s possible for the 
content to spill outside of the box
