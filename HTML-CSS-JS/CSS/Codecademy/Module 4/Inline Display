Every HTML element has a default display value that dictates 
if it can share horizontal space with other elements. Some 
elements fill the entire browser from left to right regardless 
of the size of their content. Other elements only take up as 
much horizontal space as their content requires and can be 
directly next to other elements.


display property: inline, block, and inline-block


The default display for some elements, such as <em>, <strong>, 
and <a>, is called inline. Inline elements have a box that 
wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount 
of space necessary to display their content and not requiring 
a new line after each element.

The CSS display property provides the ability to make any element 
an inline element.


h1 {
  display: inline;
}
