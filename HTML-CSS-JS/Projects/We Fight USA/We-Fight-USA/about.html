    <div id="aboutus_par">
    <p>At We Fight USA, we always aim to overcome our obstacles. But behind the gloves, we're all still humans. We push you to learn to defend yourself but more than anything we push you to believe in yourself. People may speculate a Martial Arts gym is full of angry people but to tell the truth, most of our students are calmer when they leave the gym then when they went in. <strong>Power</strong>, <strong>Discipline</strong> and <strong>Focus</strong>.  There are the makings of a strong human being. So lets get in the gym and work at it.</p>
