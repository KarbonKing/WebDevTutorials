All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use 
in the absence of an external stylesheet. These default 
stylesheets are known as user agent stylesheets. In this 
case, the term user agent is a technical term for the browser.


* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}


The code in the example above resets the default margin and 
padding values of all HTML elements. It is often the first 
CSS rule in an external stylesheet.
