Creating Inline Styles in HTML

To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute 
directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, 
you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) youâ€™d like 
applied to that element.

<p style='color: red;'>I'm learning to code!</p>

<p style='color: red; font-size: 20px;'>I'm learning to code!</p>
