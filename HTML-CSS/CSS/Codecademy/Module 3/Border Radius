You can modify the corners of an elementâ€™s border box 
with the border-radius property.

div.container {
  border: 3px solid blue;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

The code in the example above will set all four corners 
of the border to a radius of 5 pixels




You can create a border that is a perfect circle by first 
creating an element with the same width and height, and then 
setting the radius equal to half the width of the box, which 
is 50%.


div.container {
  height: 60px;
  width: 60px;
  border: 3px solid blue;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
