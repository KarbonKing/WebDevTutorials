Attributes


<div id="intro">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>

Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, 
from providing information to changing styling.


Attributes are made up of the following two parts:
The name of the attribute
The value of the attribute

id = name of the attribute
value = "intro"


id is one of the most commonly used elements.
We can use the id attribute to specify different content (such as <div>s) and is really helpful when you 
use an element more than once. ids have several different purposes in HTML.



When needed, the id value can be called upon by CSS and JavaScript to manipulate, format, and perform specific 
instructions on that element and that element only. Valid id attributes should begin with a letter and should 
only contain letters (a-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).
