Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color:

- width—The thickness of the border. A border’s thickness can be 
set in pixels or with one of the following keywords: thin, medium, 
or thick.

- style—The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of 
10 different styles. Some of these styles include: none, dotted, 
and solid.

- color—The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using 
a few different formats, including 140 built-in color keywords.



p {
  border: 3px solid coral;
}



The default border is medium none color, where 
color is the current color of the element.



p.content-header {
  border: solid coral;
}


In this example, the border style is set to solid and the color is 
set to coral. The width is not set, so it defaults to medium.
