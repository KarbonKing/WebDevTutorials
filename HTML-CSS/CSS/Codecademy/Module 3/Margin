Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. 
The margin property is used to specify the size of this space.

p {
  border: 1px solid aquamarine;
  margin: 20px;
}

The code in the example above will place 20 pixels of space 
on the outside of the paragraphâ€™s box on all four sides.





margin: 25px 50px 75px 100px;

top margin is 25px
right margin is 50px
bottom margin is 75px
left margin is 100px


margin: 25px 50px 75px;

top margin is 25px
right and left margins are 50px
bottom margin is 75px


margin: 25px 50px;

top and bottom margins are 25px
right and left margins are 50px


Horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always 
displayed and added together. Unlike horizontal margins, 
vertical margins do not add. Instead, the larger of the two vertical 
margins sets the distance between adjacent elements.
