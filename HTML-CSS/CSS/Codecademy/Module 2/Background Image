One option is to make the background of an element an image. 
This is done through the CSS property background-image.

.main-banner {
  background-image: url('https://www.example.com/image.jpg');
}


.

The url can be a file within your project, or it can be a link 
to an external site. To link to an image inside an existing 
project, you must provide a relative file path.

.main-banner {
  background-image: url('images/mountains.jpg');
}
