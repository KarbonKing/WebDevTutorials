!important can be applied to specific declarations, 
instead of full rules. It will override any style no 
matter how specific it is. As a result, it should almost 
never be used.Since !important is used on the p selectorâ€™s 
color attribute, all p elements will appear blue, even 
though there is a more specific .main p selector that 
sets the color attribute to red.

One justification for using !important is when working 
with multiple stylesheets.



p {
  color: blue !important;
}
