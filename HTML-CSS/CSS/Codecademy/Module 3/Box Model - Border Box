Many properties in CSS have a default value and donâ€™t have 
to be explicitly set in the stylesheet.
In CSS, the box-sizing property controls the type of box
model the browser should use when interpreting a web page.

The default value of this property is content-box. This
is the same box model that is affected by border thickness
and padding.

Under this box model, the border thickness and padding are 
added to the overall dimensions of the box. This makes it 
difficult to accurately size a box.

width + padding + border = actual rendered width of an element's box




Fortunately, we can reset the entire box model and specify a new one: border-box.

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}


The code in the example above resets the box model to border-box for all HTML elements.
In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed. 
The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box, 
which means the overall dimensions of the box do not change.
